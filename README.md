# Touristcast

## Description

A group project where we aimed to predict hotel stays from 2018-2019 for 13 regions in France

## Interactive Heatmap by Aysun Akarsu

A heatmap showing magnitude of hotel stays from Jan 2013 to Jan 2019, created and hosted by [Aysun Akarsu](https://github.com/aysunakarsu)

(2018 and 2019 are predicted values)
